<blockquote>
<p>Burton High School is a well-known academic high school, each student may choose an academy before their sophomore year. I believe that many of us chose AoAME, because it seems like a easy course and it is the most interesting of three, and I'm no exception. This was the class that only assigned "classwork" and free time in class, we usually finish every assignment in class. 
    In the beginning of sophomore year, I was assigned to interview some of the athletes and coaches for our school website. It was the first time that I formally interviewed few strangers. It was my first step on the AoAME path. Consequently, I would be proud of every project I have made, every pitch I have presented, and every skill I have learned. We mostly used Adobe software in AoAME, one of my favorite software was Photoshop in the first year. It motivated me to explore more facts about photographs and commercial. One day, we were working on Photoshop for swapping pictures together. I noticed that if we want a perfect composition, we need to zoom in on each small detail of the picture, and fix it one by one. Even though that project took me a week to finish it, the outcome was worth it. 
   Being part of AoAME was one of my most meaningful experience I had, it includes learning Adobe software and other computer skills, as well as teamwork, leadership, and taking responsibility. Some people say high school is all about AP classes, some people say it is all about extracurricular activities, I say it is all about preparation for decision. The more work we have done in this course, the more respect I have for anyone who work in social media.</p>
